# Repo where I put the expositions of my Geometry Differential 2 class

* **Primera** Here I calculate the first fundamental form of a parametrized curve 

* **Segunda** Here I solve the exercise 5 of the section 2.5 of the Do Carmo's book where we express the area in a different way, and create some visualizations

* **Tercera** Here I solve the exercise 11 of the section 2.5 of the Do Carmo's book
